"""``scripts/check-proxy.sh`` asserts the standards of ADR 0086 in every pass.

The script needs Docker and runs in CI (step *proxy check*). This test keeps its shape honest
without Docker: the TLS-version and HSTS checks belong to ``edge_checks``, which every pass
calls, every pass also runs the round trip, and the wrong proxy address is tried once.
